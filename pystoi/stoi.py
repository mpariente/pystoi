    Computes the STOI (See [1][2]) of a denoised signal compared to a clean
    signal, The output is expected to have a monotonic relation with the
    subjective speech-intelligibility, where a higher score denotes better
    speech intelligibility.

    # Arguments
        x (np.ndarray): clean original speech
        y (np.ndarray): denoised speech
        fs_sig (int): sampling rate of x and y
        extended (bool): Boolean, whether to use the extended STOI described in [3]

    # Returns
        float: Short time objective intelligibility measure between clean and
